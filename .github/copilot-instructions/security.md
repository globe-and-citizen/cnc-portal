# Security

## Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Sanitize data before display
- Use proper validation libraries (e.g., Zod, Yup)

## Smart Contract Interactions

- Always validate contract addresses before interactions
- Implement proper access control checks
- Handle contract revert reasons gracefully
- Use secure random number generation
