# Performance Optimization

## Reactivity

- Use `shallowRef()` for large objects that don't need deep reactivity
- Implement `v-memo` for expensive list rendering
- Use `markRaw()` for non-reactive objects
- Avoid unnecessary watchers

## Code Splitting

- Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

This file will be expanded with detailed performance optimization guidelines.
