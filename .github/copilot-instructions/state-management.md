# State Management

## Pinia Stores

- Use Pinia for global state management
- Define typed stores with proper interfaces
- Implement actions for complex state mutations
- Use getters for computed store values

## Local State

- Keep component state minimal and focused
- Use `ref()` for primitive values
- Use `reactive()` for objects that need deep reactivity
- Implement proper cleanup in `onUnmounted()`

This file will be expanded with detailed state management patterns.
