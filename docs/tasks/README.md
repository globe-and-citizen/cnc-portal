## Creating New Tasks

When creating a new task file:

1. **Keep it short** - Tasks should be less than 200 lines
2. **One clear goal** - Each task should have a single, focused objective
3. **Include verification** - Add commands to verify the task is complete
4. **Make it actionable** - Write clear, copy-paste ready instructions
5. **Number sequentially** - Use format: `NN-task-name.md`
